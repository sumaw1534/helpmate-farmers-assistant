India is called the land of farmers, as most of the people of the country are directly or indirectly involved in the agriculture sector, therefore crop selection process is one of the important factors which impacts Indian economy. The crop growth is influenced by various factors such as soil, water availability, land location, temperature, money, etc. In this work traditional algorithms like Multiple-Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest have been applied to predict the suitable crop for the respective season and farmers current conditions. Though these algorithms classify the crops, using boosting algorithms like XG-Boost, it improves the efficiency of model used. Considering each crop has its different growth rate, a relative district wise rainfall data is also considered as an input parameter for prediction. The model is deployed on a web application, where the user can insert needful parameters of crop to further get a suitable and efficient crop to grow. The web application also recommends pesticides and needful machines for crop production to farmer.
